Ordered a cot but really no room to set up had to block bathroom. Great for a two person stay, also free breakfast was for only two people, so had to pay for kids.",Belmont NH,137
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Kathryn,3.0,"This is my second stay recently. Rooms are decent but you can forget about the amenities they advertise. The pool is nice, but good luck finding a towel or staff person. Its not easy to get the complimentary breakfast.......you need to know the secret handshake then be prepared to wait an hour for a server and even more for the meal to cook. If you try to have breakfast there take a look around the restaurant and see how many table have food.......or more likely you will see empty tables with angry/hungry customers and 1 server trying to keep everyone happy.Its a decent hotel that does not hire enough staff to maintain the amenities. I feel bad for the employees of this hotel.......they are very pleasant but obviously over worked. This hotel is good if you need a place to crash but that is about it. I will try a different hotel when I am in Waterville again.",Belmont NH,137

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Melanie,5.0,Free breakfast was great dinner not so much. I don't know why I thought sweet potato encrusted haddock sounded good. They also buried it in a white gravy. Gravy does not belong on fish.,Belmont NH,137
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,A Traveler,3.0,"Hotel was clean and room size was fine. Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a 14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost 20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there. Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area.",Belmont NH,137
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,A Traveler,4.0,"The hotel was very clean, comfortable, and accommodating to the fact that we had a dog.

Bathroom in the room was not cleaned. Mirrors were dirty. It's like the rooms were done in a hurry! Roll away bed was pushed in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket. The reservation was for 3. Just a set of 2 towels. We had the heat full blast, and we froze in the middle of the night. Very poor managed!",Augusta,74

Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a $14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost $20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there.

Anyone could enter the building. Crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building. The A/C unit was very old with missing knobs and instructions that were worn off. Getting the room to a comfortable temperature was a challenge. Dirty used towels were hanging in the shower questioning whether the room had been properly cleaned from the prior occupant. Duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains.

They offer memberships to the pool and exercise room to non guests. Pool was not very clean. Was given 2 towels and wash clothes for 4 people in a room. Website stated free breakfast but neglected to say it was for 2 and you pay tax and gratuity for the free ones also. Website and book in room said there are snack vending machines and there are only ice and soda vending machines. Shower was luke warm and no way to make it warmer. Worst hotel I have ever stayed in.,Quebec City,1360

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,A verified traveler,5.0,"We found this hotel while travelling and had read a few bad reviews due to it being renovated!!! We had time to go echeck it out before actually booking!! We asked to see a room and were very pleasantly surprises by how lovely and new the hotel and room was!! They. Have done a great job of the Reno!! The hallways, rooms and main areas are clean plus and very tastefully decorated!! The room had great beds and high end quality linens. The room was large and spacious!! We stayed at the hotel for dinner as there was a bar/restaurant on the premesis!! Super friendly staff and the food was of very good quality for pub food!! Nice not to have to go looking for a place to eat after being on the road all day! Another of the hotel amenities was the great gym and pool area!! Dosen,t get any better anywhere!!! High end equipment , pool and jacuzzi!, another great perk is, in the morning the from lobby staff give you a $7.00 voucher per person for breakfast in the hotel!!! This is not your average Best Western!! We had a lovely bacon/ egg brkf for $0,,, All the staff were super friendly and seemed like they loved their jobs!!! My only complaint is the fact that people are allowd to smoke in some of the rooms!! Smoking is not segregated by floors!! We instantly could smell cig smoke when we went to the second floor!! We also could smell MJ coming from one room!! To bad this hotel is allowing smoking within especially since they have done such a fine job of renovating!! In this day and age, smoking in hotels or anywhere inside is just not acceptable!! I hope this hotel changes their policy as it would be a shame to ruin such a great Reno,d to new hotel!!",Quebec City,1360

When I got to my room, I had the smallest tube in the world. Remind you that I'm 6'1' and a big dude. They also gave me a small double bed. My leg was hanging out the bed the whole night. To make thing even worse, I went out to dinner with my girl and than came back to the same sheet they had the night before. They basically put a clean sheet on top of the dirty sheet. I didn't notice it until I pull the white sheet to check the bed. They didn't change our pillow sheet at all. I wouldn't get mad if it was a cheap hotel. I paid 125 dollar a night for that room and they have the audacity to not change my bed sheet. I was so embarrass for bringing my girl to this hotel. The picture look good online, but when you get to the hotel, it's a different ball game. The room is not that large, compare to the picture. They didn't even have a microwave in the room.

Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Tiffany L,3.0,"Myself, husband, and two year old daughter booked 4 nights at the double tree. It was my first time in West Palm Beach. I was barely impressed with this hotel, being a large name brand, I expected more. The room was centrally located near the airport and highways which was great, thankfully we decided to rent a car because there was no scenery or activities to do near the hotel. The outside and lobby was pretty, very similar to other business hotels. I was extremely dissapointed upon check in when we realized the hotel pool was not only not in service, but it was completely empty. That was the only reason we booked this hotel was for the pool so again we had to drive to even swim on our family vacation. The room was mediocre, similar to a stay at our local hotels in the north east. The breakfast was over priced 15 per person for a breakfast buffet. Overall I would suggest not staying here while on vacation unless you are fully aware in order to do anything fun you must drive there. Also be sure to call before you check in to be sure the pool is in service. For the amount that was spend which was almost 150 per night I think we could have found a better place for our first family trip with our daughter. Good luck hope this helps.",Ruther Glen,1441

It does not hold up to what a Hilton used to be. This hotel did not have a TV guide in the room nor on the TV screen for guests to know what was playing in Florida. That was the biggest complaint. There was a list of stations, such as, ABC, NBC, HGTV, etc. That was all in the room. When I called down for assistance, I was told that that was all the hotel had to offer. I also expected a better quality of coffee maker. The staff was excellent however. Overall, I will not put hotels bought out by Hilton on my list of places to stay in the future.

I explained my dilemma and although I was extremely early they did their best to get a room available and gave me directions to the t-mobile store so I could get a replacement phone. By the time I returned the room was ready and the woman who checked me in had a message from my wife and she read it aloud to me in such a nice way. I was really impressed by the welcome and all the help. The room was nicely decorated and I was just looking to take a shower and relax a bit before I went to meet up with some friends. And there it was... black mold in the shower. Clearly visible and of course once I saw it I looked under some of the fixtures in the shower and found a lot more. Gross. Other than that the room was basically very comfortable. Air conditioning worked well. Television worked well. Free WiFi was a treat. Outlets galore for your cell phones, tablets, laptops etc. Really efficient room. Pool was nice. Fitness room was clean and modern facilities. It was so difficult to actually get someone to assist you in the restaurant that I walked out twice and found someplace else to eat. That and the black mold were the only negative aspects. I would definitely stay there again. Oh and the self parking made for easy mobility if you rent a car. If not, use uber as the cab cost 3x more.",Massapequa,974

Chef Bud is great.",Medway,992
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,A,3.0,"Nice check in with pleasant young man. I noticed there was no water in the front lobby like most resorts have. No food available because it was off season (not even apples which most hotels offer as well). If we wanted anything to eat we would have had to drive into town. We had just driven 8 hours and it was snowing, so that wasn't something we wanted to do. Our room was very small with an option to be connected to the room next door if it was family. Since we didn't have family the door remained locked, but we could hear all the conversations, music and TV thru the door cracks. Coffee maker is stored under the sink in the bathroom. If you want to use it, you have to remove everything from the VERY SMALL counter space that is there. There is NO counter space in the room, only 4 drawers. View was nice from the windows, shower was nice. I requested a queen size bed, and got a double bed. My husband is 6'2 and his feet were hanging over the edge. Bed and mattress needed upgrading. Might be great for skiers who just want to ski and crash and not have any amenities or comfort. Even the main lodge had no where to sit and be comfy, as it was dark and had workmen in there cleaning. The young man checking us out was same person checking us in. He was pleasant.",Medway,992
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,Warren,3.0,"The lodge room was spartan with no desk or shelf area nor chair. If you wanted to watch TV you had to lay or seat on the bed. Using the coffee maker was impossible since on the sink was the only location adding risk if you were trying to get ready (teeth, etc) at the same time. There is a nook in the room which a shelf could easily be added for the coffee maker and ice bucket making room around the sink. In addition there is room for a chair in the room and would be easy to provide a lap desk (board to be placed on lap for laptop, etc). If you are going to use room as individual hotel room these should be a minimum since the main room is not available. I asked the front desk to have maintenance unlock the safe (locked shut by previous tenants) and they logged the request. Reminded them each morning and never done...on checkout the front desk did remove parking fees since this was not accomplished. In addition requested a temporary chair but never delivered. Front desk staff was great and did their job but beyond that nothing happened. Overall staff at desk, restaurant, and housekeeping were friendly and did an outstanding job.

The *only* complaint is the lack of parking. We were told they have 140 units and only 25 parking spaces so when they are busy its mandatory valet. We visited in the summer and had hiking, biking fishing day trips planned so it was somewhat of an inconvenience to have to rely on valet parking the first day.

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,David K,4.0,The people above us were really loud. The floor stomping was over the top.

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,A Traveler,4.0,"We made a short trip to Telluride, mostly to view Fall foliage. Unfortunately we were a little bit late for the peak of that. The room we reserved was actually described on the web site as a tiny room -- surprisingly. Seemed to be a lock-off room that is part of a larger condo unit. It was by no means the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in but was rather poorly designed, especially in the bathroom closet area. Finding the promised coffee maker was a bit of a challenge -- it was hidden in the cabinet under the sink. Similarly the one waste basket was hidden in a back corner behind the toilet. The toilet and bath/shower were in a separate compartment with a ridiculous door that was just about impossible to close. I didn't try. The shower/bath combo had sliding glass doors that made it very awkward to use also -- a curtain would have been far better. Much of the closet space was totally inaccessible with a floor mounted safe facing sideways -- would have been a challenge to use. The toilet was extraordinarily low, as was the one easy chair in the room. It took a long time for the electric wall heater to warm the room and its contents to a comfortable temperature tho it was not that cold outside yet. Other than this, it was a nice enough room with a decent view. Not only was there a hefty fee for parking, it turned out that valet parking was mandatory and that parking seemed in very short supply. Excellent hamburgers in the restaurant.",Fort Collins,539

The hotel staff were extremely helpful with showing us how to use the gondolas and where the various hiking trail heads were located they even gave us an outstanding map. The main drawbacks of the hotel are the small size of the room and the lack of sound deadening between rooms. At check-in, the person tried to upgrade us to a larger room (for 60 more a night) however, since we were already paying over 200 a night, we declined to upgrade. Anyway, the room we were in was next to a utility room with a loud hot water heater that cycled on and off all night. Also, the walls were so thin that we could hear the conversations of the people next to us. To top it off, there were two rooms near us with barking dogs one two doors down and one right across the hall.

Hampton Inn Fayetteville Fort Bragg,Ann,1.0,"Hotel was old and room needed remodeling. The first time we flushed the toilet it overflowed onto our bathroom floor. When I called to have maintenance come up (at approx 9:30pm) to unclog the toilet, I was told that there was no one there to do that for me and that I could come down to the front desk and get the plunger to handle myself. I was told most guests prefer to do this themselves because they do not want strangers in their room. Really I'm on vacation - clearly that wasn't something that was on my must do list. I asked about changing rooms and was told they were sold out. I'm not sure that was truthful since the parking lot was clearly not full. With 3 children and it being 10pm at this point, finding a new hotel wasn't really an option. After being handed a plunger and extra towels I unclogged my own toilet and then proceeded to act as Certfied Plumber two more times that night and the next morning. Breakfast the next morning was the one positive of this stay. I never spoke to the manager - when I went to the desk in the morning to voice my concerns I was told she was on a conference call. The front desk clerk informed us that our bill would be reduced 20. She apologized and said because they aren't a 5 star hotel they do not have 24 hour maintenance.

We called the front desk and they were very accommodating and gave us a new set but at this point we were very disappointed . The hotel is also only 3 floors and it took what felt like forever for the elevator to come. Over 10 minute waiting time on average . They don't have any other elevators and were transporting the garbage on the same elevators as the guests which stunk the elevator up like a garbage disposal. When we needed to get any dinnerware we had to ask at the front desk because the room had none and we had to wait for it to be washed because apparently they don't have any clean ones readily available.

They did have a smaller room downstairs. Because I went through a 3 rd party, they said I had call and cancel previous reservation. Too much trouble. We were so disappointed. There was plenty of time for them to notify us about not having a downstairs room. We only found 1 ice machine downstairs in the lobby. Wasn't given the password for wifi.

Comfort Inn Livermore,BK,1.0,"1) They gave me a room in the 2nd floor even though my son is an infant baby, and I had to bring stroller all the time. The old man in front desk said that all rooms were sold out, but during I stayed there for 4 day, I could not see more than 20 cars in the parking lot. I am sure he told a lie. 2) The room had very bad smell. It was like human's odor. 3) Near the hotel, some construction was going on, I guess. They made loud noise from 6-7 am. I could not sleep well. 4) On 3rd day, the faucet of the bath tub was broken. Since I stayed there for my business, I had to hurry up. I couldn't turn off the faucet for 2 hours. So, they gave me another room to use the restroom which is at the end of the building and my room was at the another end of the building. It took around to 5 minutes to walk for washing my hands. 5) There were dead cockroaches in the refrigerator and some parts(dial) was broken. It didn't work well, and I complained about that to the old man who I mentioned early. He said that the only thing he could do was that he could leave message for maintenance. Also, he said he would look for the dial. However, he did not gave me new dial. Also, he did not leave message. I will never recommend this dirty and uncomfortable hotel.",Topeka,1707

The bathroom trim also needed paint. I felt like the room was not as clean as it should be so I never let my bare feet touch the floor. I won't be staying at this hotel again.

The breakfast had a full assortment of food items- everything from eggs sausage to oatmeal yoghurt waffles. They had a nice fitness room with 4 different aerobic machines a circuit weight machine-- also cold water with cups work-out towels available. It would be nice if hotels would provide a pair of scissors in the desk and an extension cord or more (accessible) outlets for all the chargers.

However, if you needed anything, you could contact the Front Desk staff and they would accommodate you. There was no breakfast served because all of the rooms are equipped with a full kitchen and stocked with plates, silverware, etc. There is a mini-market in the lobby where you could purchase items by charging to your room or pay by cash. The room was clean, but smaller than I thought. There isn't a living room area, but one recliner in the corner, so I wouldn't necessarily consider that a suite but it was fine for the amount of time that we spent in the room. Also, our room was on the 1st floor facing the parking lot, so we could not open our curtains to let any light in or else everyone from the parking lot could see into our room.

Holiday Inn Express Dahlonega,Brent H,4.0,"The hotel has clearly just been remodeled/updated and is very nice inside, and the staff was super friendly. Fridge and Microwave in the room is a big plus. The free hot breakfast was as good as any at this level of hotel. The location is a quick drive or short ride/walk into the center of town. Only a couple of neutral/negative comments. First, they do not have any roll-away beds available while other hotels in the area do offer them, and this made for awkward sleeping arrangements for the 3 in our group. Secondly, we came for a bicycle ride and since we didn't want to leave the bikes on the outside of the car overnight we planned on bringing them into the room, but the desk attendant stopped us and said the policy was no bikes in the rooms. On the plus side they were using the conference room as staging area for renovation material and he let us lock our bikes in that room overnight which was actually better, but if not under construction I am afraid this wouldn't be the case. In an area where there is a large amount of bicycle tourism not being able to bring the bike inside is a definite negative, though I do understand that with nice new rooms they don't want the dirt and grime of bikes being tracked inside. All in all, I was glad we spent a few extra for this hotel vs others we have stayed in due to the nice new renovations, friendly staff, and much more variety in the free breakfast.",Alabama,13

When I called, the front desk lady/manager Diane was extremely rude and told me there was no way her employee would have told me that there was no cancellation fee. When I told her maybe the employee made a mistake, she said there was no way he would make that mistake and called me a liar. When I stated that sometimes employees make mistakes and I was positive I had asked about cancel fees, she said that was impossible and that I was wrong and every single hotel in the entire world(!!) charges cancellation fees. After a heated argument, I asked for the corporate number to make a complaint. I explained to the corporate office that I had been sick and was unable to attend and had been given no indication that there would be a cancellation charge (full cost for the over priced room). She was very nice and sympathetic and I confirmed that I could get a doctors note proving I was ill. She said that the Hotel owner or GM would call me to discuss and I would possibly have to provide the doctors note. That was over a week ago and I haven't heard from anyone.

Holiday Inn Express - Harrisburg East,Raymond,3.0,"Hotel location very convenient to highways, city, Hershey. Plenty of restaurants, stores, cheap gas. Car wash across street. Free Hershey's kisses and cookies in lobby. Breakfast at 6am. Great selection, though hot food not at restaurant quality. The OJ had a musty aftertaste. I told the breakfast server, who needed clarification in Spanish, then she shrugged and did nothing. I was offered only a connecting room which I hate, nothing else available. Desk person very helpful and did give me a quiet room. Traveler should beware that they allow pets in this hotel (check!), try to keep them on 2nd floor, but this time someone slipped their dog into their room on the 5th floor which if you get a room next to a whining, barking, door scratching dog you're out of luck.",Baltimore,93

Holiday Inn Express - Harrisburg East,A Traveler,1.0,"I have never written a review like this and thought the previous reviewers were exaggerating or just expecting too much from a Holiday Inn Express. I was wrong. Clearly, the hotel is trying very hard to cover up an unpleasant smell, and with no way to open a window or gain access to fresh air, the smell is truly overwhelming. When we first arrived, I thought the smell in the lobby was bad (a combination of stale smoke, damp must, and something they have sprayed to try to cover it up) but the smell in our room was even worse. There was no relief from it because the windows are sealed shut and it was too late for us to find another hotel.",Baltimore,93
Holiday Inn Express - Harrisburg East,Patrice,2.0,"The room felt very damp and carried a musty odor throughout the stay. Beds were made for second night but floor not vacuumed or supplies replenished. The door wouldn't shut unless pushed very hard, even after maintenance looked at it. Breakfast was available and as a free alternative it was reasonable. (Juice was terrible...orange-flavored water at best) But hot and cold choices. When a water-outage left us high and dry (literally), I was disappointed management didn't offer up bottles of water to brush teeth, wash faces, etc. Probably wouldn't stay again. Location very close to restaurants and Hershey Park.",Baltimore,93

The feather pillows were old and completely flat. They kept us awake during the night with having to constantly fluff. The keyless entry was broken on the side door of the hotel. If you arrived to breakfast after 8 am it was slim pickings. The staff did not replenish items that were gone. Also, the pancake maker was broken. There were Hershey kisses in a bowl next to the elevator upon arrival. They were never replenished in the 2 days we were there. Not a big deal, but it was a cute touch that they also fell short on.

The bedding was very thin and the mattresses and pillows weren't very comfortable at all. It's a low frills room so I didn't expect to get blown away, but I did expect the fundamentals to be strong for the price. For other amenities, WiFi was artificially slowed so they can upsell on faster experience, so be aware. Utensils were available, but you have to ask, it would have been more welcoming to have them in the cabinets. Overall not a terrible experience, just kind of forgettable and didn't really make me feel I got a good value.

The worst part for me is that no one bothered to clean my room! Please do not stay at this hotel if you are a light sleeper. I stayed at the hotel for two nights and both nights I could hear people talking in the 6 am hour. The first night was okay since I was was already up and prepping for my day but the second night I was highly irritated because I planned on sleeping in. The bed is very uncomfortable and the pillows were flat. The kitchen was spotless. I was very impressed. The bathtub had some stains and it was hard to tell if it was dirt or permanent stains. The carpet was extremely old and looked like it needed to be vacuumed. I got a non-smoking room that smelled like smoke. The breakfast is a limited menu consisting of coffee, muffins, granola bars, and apples. The walls are paper thin so you could hear doors opening and closing, people walking on the hallway on my level and the level above me, and people having conversations outside. At one point I was convinced that someone was breaking into my door when I was awoken from sleep.

The rod for hanging clothes is very poorly placed in the approximate two feet between the bed and the wall, making it extremely awkward to get out of the bed on that side duck or hit your head. An iron and ironing board hang in the bathroom. The lavatory is in the bathroom and has little counter space.

Been there since 1926 - we had some very unusual and tasty tapas. Prices start from 90cents with good local inexpensive wines. Lots of locals use this tapas bar. Tricky getting from Murcia city to Murcia San Javier airport (40 km) - quoted 70 euros for taxi. Train to nearest station would cost 13 euros plus a further 23 euros to get from train station to airport. We used the no 70 bus, leaves from stand number 8 in the main bus station (4.35 euros) to San Javier town and then a 10 euro, 5 minute taxi ride. allow plenty of time to get your bus tickets.

La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Casey,1.0,"We booked a standard King, non-smoking room. When we got there, they gave us a smoking room that smelled and looked horrible. When I asked if we could move to a non-smoking room, like we had booked, they said that the room was a non-smoking room (then why was there an ashtray on the sink) and that someone must have broken the rules and smoked in the room previously. They said they were completely booked and could not move us. We had to keep the window open during our entire stay (low of 25 degrees one night) just so we could breathe. There were stains all over the walls from where people had been smoking in that room for a long time. There were also body hairs in the shower when we got there. Not just one or two, but multiple hairs all over the tub. When we went down for breakfast Sunday morning at 7am, both trash cans were completely full and people had begun leaving their trash on the tables. We never saw an employee while we were down there. I have stayed with LaQuinta multiple times before and have never had an issue. I will definitely never stay at this location again after this terrible experience.",Englewood,488

La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Northerner,2.0,"Disappointing, but it was on the cheap side, so I guess you get what you pay for sometimes. Rooms were pretty dirty and things seemed outdated. We used the pool and the staff gave my wife a hard time asking for 5 pool towels. If we were rude people, we would have told them off, but we are sometimes overly considerate. This is our chance to tell everyone what we think now. They allow pets here and so things just seemed on the dirty side. Hotel staff, as I indicated, were borderline rude. They were busy when we got there, but no reason to roll your eyes at us. Seriously I wonder what happened to Southern Hospitality and the customer is always right It's not like we asked for anything out of the ordinary. Consequently, we stayed at the Best Western (Downtown Nashville) on our way back through town: Much cleaner. Much nicer. Updated. Very comfortable beds. Excellent (Continental) breakfast.

That said, the fire alarm went off due to a firecracker set off by someone on the upper floors and we all had to evacuate. All of that is procedural and that's fine, but the front desk personnel never left the desk and then when we politely asked if we could go back inside we were met with an employee who was neither willing to explain what was going on nor nice about addressing us. She stood in front of the doors like a guard dog, talking to us like we were all unruly children (though no one was crowding the door, not following protocol, or otherwise giving the staff reason to be that stern). It was very clear that there was no emergency. The hotel was understaffed, which is why I think the staff morale seemed low--it was a holiday weekend, so I wonder about their willingness to be there. I had to literally search for an employee when it was time to check out the front desk personnel was actually in the back washing dishes from breakfast at check-out time. The only thing I really care about in a hotel breakfast is coffee, and they didn't even have real coffee. It was a NesCafe machine, and it wasn't working properly when I was there--very disappointing. Overall, it was a decent stay. My main issue was with staff, but they were dealing with a lot on the holiday weekend and I don't think there was enough staff there.

There were definite signs of wear - walking patterns in carpets, chinks in the paint, etc. The carpets were clean though, and the chinks were visible through new paint - not untended at all.

However, just this week they recharged my credit card for our stay in July (its now September). I called them and told them that I had this charge on a previous statement and the lady who apparently was the person to talk to about this, told me that it was a pending change and that it didn't really charge the card. This was BS. Furthermore, she explained how a bunch of credit cards got stuck and the were re-running them. My credit card is currently disputing the charge after confirming that it was a second charge. I will get the charge removed. What bothers me is not so much the mistake, but that this seems highly unethical. I keep close track of my spending in an excel spreadsheet, but if I didn't, which most people probably don't, I probably would have assumed it never got charged and let it go. And if there are people out there doing this to a group of cards, I'm sure many people will let it go and get charged twice. THIS SEEMS TO ME TO BE PRETTY UNETHICAL.

Water pipes broke at some point during our stay and they did not have the courtesy to come and tell us. When we figured this out I went to the front desk to ask for a different room and was told it would be fixed within the hour. Again, no one bothered to tell us when it was fixed. I felt that should have been a common courtesy. Black particles would blow in our room from the swamp cooler. The room was every dirty and although it was close to the beach it was not worth it.

Unfortunately, mostly everything the other reviews said also applied to our stay. The room was more of a condo, which was nice. It had a fold away couch and a full kitchen with all the appliances and even dishes and pots and pans. All that however did not do us any good if we didn't sleep all night since both a/c units were extremely noisy. We had to turn off the one in the bedroom because we could not sleep, so we were sweating instead. Even if we COULD sleep, we still didn't, since the bed was sunken, the springs were non-existent. Also even though the hotel provided internet, there was no signal strong enough to allow for more than a 30 second connection.

Extended Stay America - Raleigh - Cary - Regency Parkway S,Michael,2.0,"While it wasn't horrible, it was sub-par for the pricing. 1. The back door to the place, was jammed open, so anyone could enter the hotel without a card and supervision. This really bothered me. 2. There were no supplies, and I had to make several trips to the front desk to get essentials like the cups and plates (twice because even though I said I 4 people in the room, they gave me supplies for 2), and again for the pots and pans -- that I usually have waiting for me in the room when I come to these types of places with a kitchenette. 3. No toilet paper, had to go down to the front desk for that on the second day. They don't stock the rooms. 4. Food crumbs and other tidbits in the roll-out bed. I had my kids with me, and was pulling out the roll out bed so I had enough beds, and discovered food crumbs under the couch cushions and on the bed itself. I had to go to the front desk (again) for the sheets, blankets and etc.. They didn't have pillows for the roll out beds. 5. They said they offered a breakfast, I went down, they had coffee, some old stale muffins, oatmeal packets. Normally I expect if they say they have breakfast it is a full service, with a waffle bar, a choice of cereal. This one is pretty minor overall. 6. Vending machines were inoperative for laundry supplies. 7. Burn marks on the counter tops. Good points: Staff is very friendly, laundry on site, good location.",Buffalo,219
Extended Stay America - Raleigh - Cary - Regency Parkway S,Joseph,3.0,First time staying in an extended stay facility. Room was okay. Went to front desk about ice and was told it was in the ice trays in the refrigerator freezer in the room. No way I'm using ice from some funky looking ice trays that I don't know how clean they are or who has touched them. Vending machines were practically empty. Hotel entrance doors were hard to open and no power door opener for handicap or if you had your arms full. It would be pretty much impossible for someone in a wheelchair to come in or go out unassisted. Surprised that doesn't violate some code. Free wifi was a joke since it was about the speed of dial-up. Wanted you to pay extra for any usable speed so I used the hotspot on my phone. Several big construction trucks parking across multiple spaces and taking up about half the spaces close to the lobby entrance when they should have parked in another area of the parking lot. It was someplace to sleep and the access to the main highway was good.,Buffalo,219

Upon check in, I was told that housekeeping had not cleaned the room. I was forced to upgrade back to the original queen size bed and was told there was a pullout couch in the room. When I got in the room ready to go to sleep, the pullout couch was filthy and did not have sheets or comforter. When I tried to get someone from the front desk to bring some to the room, no one answered. Over all I was very disappointed and feel that the room was extremely over priced for the service and quality of the room.",Buffalo,219
Extended Stay America - Raleigh - Cary - Regency Parkway S,Victor,3.0,"I was a little wary about booking this place because of some negative reviews, but it was far better than expected. We arrived after midnight and had to use the phone near the lobby to summon the night help who booked us in. I needed two beds (I refuse to sleep with my brother!) and our room was quite large with a full kitchen. NOTE: buy stuff and move in! Breakfast, as reviewed by others was VERY basic, therefore buy stuff and get the free glasses, pots and pans when available. There is a gas station nearby which has a large convenience store - it's walking distance. Problem is it was never open when we were there. There is a chips and stuff machine but we also went next door to another hotel to see what they had. Of course, just a short drive are full service groceries etc. The neighborhood was very quiet. The other occupants seemed to a mix of people on the road, and extended stay workers of various types. Some of the cooking smells made me hungry.

Extended Stay America - Raleigh - Cary - Regency Parkway S,A Traveler,2.0,"I knew things were bad when I walked into the hallway and the hotel smelled similar to a hockey locker room. The rooms themselves are decent size and have nice amenities such as a kitchenette. Beds are bearable, but don't expect pillow top. I found at least 4 long strands of hair in the bathtub (I'm a dude with short hair and was traveling alone), which means that they didn't clean it from the last person. The shower also ran out of hot water after about 3 minutes. The WiFi speed is about 1MB, which is pitiful.

Extended Stay America - Raleigh - Cary - Regency Parkway S,beachbound,3.0,"We were pleasantly surprised by the room. It was large and spacious, the kitchen area was great, and it had a full sized fridge. The beds were comfortable. I dealt with two front desk women - unfortunately did not get names. One was very pleasant and helpful, the other the complete opposite. Little problems we had with the place - even though it had a full kitchen, it had no utensils or plates or anything in the room. They have a sign saying to go to the front desk for them. That is odd, but it might work. But I went to the desk to find no one there for some time, then got a very unfriendly person. She was irritated that I wanted plates at a late hour and couldn't believe we wouldn't eat from our to-go boxes. Other little thing was the breakfast, if you can call it that. No milk, no juice. There was coffee, tea, individually wrapped muffins, oatmeal packs, and then oranges and apples. That was it. Big problem was a barking dog. For many hours our neighbor had a dog that did nothing but yelp and bark. Witch at the front desk didn't care or offer to do anything about it. She said they accepted dogs and next time I should ask to be put away from pets (like I knew this ahead of time). I said they accepted people, but they are not allowed to keep others awake - she shrugged. Neighbor didn't answer door or phone. Turns out was not there - came in at 3:30 drunk.

I was greeted by a nice lady at the front desk and the check in process was fast and easy. After opening the door I was hit with a wave of heat. Apparently the A/C was turned off. As soon as I got in I turned on the A/C to start the cool down process. After having it on for an hour and the room not cooling down, I called the front office and told them of the situation. She suggested that I turn the unit off and then back on and see if that worked. I did but it didn't work. I then called back and she offered to move me into another room. She even brought the key up to me which was nice. The new room had an A/C that worked but had a horrible smell as if someone had been smoking in there for years. The A/C worked so I decided to suck it up and stayed in the room. The next morning when I checked out I was sure to tell the woman at the front desk so I wouldn't be charged for smoking in a non smoking room. Over all the staff is great and before this time I've never had any issues.",Herndon,702

While conveniently located off the Interstate it was sub-sub-par in quality. The carpet and bedspread were soiled and dirty - we left our shoes on - the ice bucket had not been emptied or cleaned and had bugs in it.

When I went to the front desk the attendant was eating and with a full mouth she told me that housekeeping had not learned how to use the new machines. She handed me dry towels that were probably as old as the hotel, they were thin and with holes in them. One was even blood stained. As far as cleaniness is concerned the room was filthy. There had to be years of build up of cob webs around the heater. There were pieces of the ceiling on the floor and the bathtub was cracked and stained. Their idea of a continental breakfast was a rotting apple that was in the basket for 3 days and a couple of stale pieces of bread. The hotel was rated a best value and it was far from that. Even at 58 dollars a night it was far from a value. DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!!!!!!",Wantagh,1785

I looked for the closest hotel with the highest rating per guest. This is what I found. I found out while staying in Newburgh it has a very high murder rate, in the Nation! We were right by the freeway and not residential around us so I did feel safe. The room was one of the quietest I have ever stayed in. I could not even hear when Mom took a shower but there was the constant elevated interstate noise, but the room was clean even through there was huge stains on the bedspreads. The cleaning staff were friendly, the handyman who replaced the broken hairdryer was friendly, the rest were either rude or did not speak. The hotel is old, hallways still smell of smoke, rugs old, but they are working on maintaining it. Breakfast was the worst I have ever experienced. Who does not have toast? They only had cereal, bagged bagels and English muffins, some juice and alternated with bagged Danish or Belgian waffles. Our reservation was a mess when we arrived. It ended up with the receptionist being rude to the Hotel.com rep. In the end we got our room, reasonably priced during the week but graduation weekend it was doubled.

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Christine,2.0,"has me seriously re-thinking if I will ever use Expedia again!! Hotel was dingy, worn down, strange smell as soon as you walked in. The room was so dim and when we went to turn the lights on, nothing worked. We were able to find a maintenance man and he came in, then had to leave to find an extension cord to plug in the light!!! Only one outlet in the room!!!! Beds should have been replaced years ago, they were so uncomfortable and the mattresses sagged so you were sleeping in a hole! Tub was from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it!! Even the new shower curtain could not disguise what was going on in there!! Honestly, we should have driven home, but decided to stay the night since it was late and there we no other hotel rooms available in the area do to Parent's weekend at the local colleges and a big rival football game. The Continental Breakfast was a joke, and by this time, we just laughed and got the hell out of there!!! Like I said, if this is what to expect from Expedia, I will never use them again, and I most certainly will never stay at the Howard Johnson Hotel again....",Wantagh,1785

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Kelley,1.0,"Check in was strange. Except the receptionist had to yell down the hall to make sure my room was done - after she checked me in. I never had that happen before. My bathroom floor had bootprints all over it and towels were stacked on the controls to flush the toilet. Then I saw that there was a door going out to the ""patio"": no furniture out there...and the door was NOT LOCKED. If I hadn't checked, anyone could have entered my room. Oh, and the free wifi only works in the lobby and you might have to walk around your room to get cell phone service. To put the icing on the cake, the continental breakfast ""danishes"" consisted of generic ho-ho's and some other generic cinnamon bun. The English muffins were stale. Need I say more? I left as quickly as possible after breakfast.",Wantagh,1785

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,A verified traveler,3.0,If your looking for a place to crash for a night you could stay at worst. You need to park in the back and no elevator to your room. So don't bring alot of luggage. Entering and exiting is confusing because exit doors look like hotel room doors. Besides low price nothing to rave about. Looks like a room in the 70's. Bathroom was clean but all the piping old. Terrible shower heads and constant drip in my tub in my room. Stay away from room 108 if running water will bother you. Plus make sure you call for towels. Only 2 to a room so if you bring your wife there won't be a towel for you if she washes her hair. Stay here only if you need to emergency crash somewhere,Wantagh,1785

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Dianne M.,1.0,"This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Not at all what the pictures at Hotel.com showed. I took pictures of the room, #1. There was old body fluids on the floor at the end of the bed. #2. There was old body fluids on the chairs that where also broken. #3. There was mold growing in the shower. #4. The ceiling tile in the bathroom was letting go of the frame work and stained with water. #5. Moved the night stand to use the receptacle only to find broken plastic and spider webs. #6. The bathroom door had been kicked in at one time and painted over didn't close at all. #7. The desk top was peeling off from the desk. #8. The sliding door to the outside was so thick with dirt.

If he knew this before, Why he couldn't give us the room we asked for on the first swap is beyond me!The heating was average at best! Must have taken a few hours for the room to be in livable condition ... We had kids with us and they were literally shivering.Bathroom tub water system was horrible.

Our room smelled horrible and the carpets were so filthy we were afraid to take off our shoes. The blankets and sheets had stains and were worn to the point of being see thru in places. In addition, the ceiling panels were falling in and the bathroom vent fan was hanging from the ceiling and didn't run. The shower allowed the temperature to go well above 140 degrees according to the controls and my son almost melted his skin off accidentally. The television was an old Mitsubishi console with white fuzz. Because we got in so late, there were no other rooms to switch to. I truly don't know how this place stays in business.

Not enough outlets to plug anything in, so don't plan on any joint preparation before you leave for the day. Not enough seating for the Continental Breakfast area.  The cleaning ladies were very pleasant, always made sure there were clean linens in the bath and beds.

It was covered up and had not been opened yet this year. And when it's 94 degrees outside that would have been nice to use the pool. My overall rating for this hotel would be poor.",Weipa,1806

When it was time for the continental breakfast, there were no tables available, so we sat on the the couch that was 4 feet from the juice machine, and we were told to go find a table. The safe in the room was locked with the door open so we couldn't store our cash in there. We left for NYC, came back, and my buddy's bag was rummaged through. He always leaves his orange hunting knife on top of his clothes, but it was under his sweatshirt and a few other things when we got back.

Beds should have been replaced years ago, they were so uncomfortable and the mattresses sagged so you were sleeping in a hole!  Tub was from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it!!  Even the new shower curtain could not disguise what was going on in there!!  Honestly, we should have driven home, but decided to stay the night since it was late and there we no other hotel rooms available in the area do to Parent's weekend at the local colleges and a big rival football game.

There were mosquitoes and and other insects all over the hallways and near the ice machine. We were glad we were staying only for one night.

If you ever left your room [ I traveled solo ], you had to have the clerk let you back in your room.  THIS IS WAY BELOW ACCEPTABLE and made leaving the room a HASSLE.  I used Expedia's no refund, lowest price option and felt trapped at check-in, when I found out, for the first time in my 65 years that the entire hotel's lock system was broken.  Live and learn.  I will NEVER use the no refund option again - How would you like it if YOU checked into a hotel and were NOT even give a room key, since they wouldn't even work.  I'd rate this a ZERO!  As other's review this hotel, it would be nice if Expedia would warn those who booked a room in advance that there is a major problem at a Hotel - naturally that did not happen - the problem, I found out too late, existed 5 days prior to my arrival.

My only complaint was a few of the housekeepers were very rude and acted annoyed if we were still in our room when them came to clean and asked to come a bit later. As well as a few of the mornings when we went to enjoy the free breakfast, some housekeepers sat and watched what we did and what we ate and how much we took. I was even told that I took ""too many plates"" when I actually needed them since I was bringing food back for my daughter and fianc��e. And while we ate I was stared at and talked about.

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,A verified traveler,4.0,"Me, my fiancée, our toddler and family friend all stayed a week in Newburgh at this hotel. We came to do visit family and spend most of our time in NYC. It was only an hour from the city. We checked in late our first night and the women at the desk was extremely friendly.. I believe her name started with an S or something. Our stay was great. We enjoyed our cozy room. Everything worked fine. Everything was decently clean and comfortable. My only complaint was a few of the housekeepers were very rude and acted annoyed if we were still in our room when them came to clean and asked to come a bit later. As well as a few of the mornings when we went to enjoy the free breakfast, some housekeepers sat and watched what we did and what we ate and how much we took. I was even told that I took ""too many plates"" when I actually needed them since I was bringing food back for my daughter and fiancée. And while we ate I was stared at and talked about. Another quick thing was they don't have any working cribs for guests who need them which definitely caused issues when it came to sleeping at night. But other than that everything was great.",keene,1950

I was told that Chad, the front desk manager, would be available the following morning and that he would be able to assist. Chad was there, as promised. He was very accommodating but unfortunately, could only do what's best for his company, not for me, the customer. I received a call back from him, after several unsuccessful attempts to reach him and after calling the health department and the regional office. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!

Working one always went down to basement before coming up to first floor to take guests up their rooms ssssslllllooooowwwwwlllllyyyyy. Elevators need replacement - in really bad shape. Too small and buttons don't work. Bldg exterior, pool area need some investment. Lobby, breakfast area in OK shape. The hallways smell like smoke - seems like a roadway motor lodge out of the 70's.

Quality Inn and Suites,Jennifer,1.0,"We had three rooms for me and family members the night before running in a Richmond 10K race. This was a mile from the start line, but other places were full or event-priced. Rooms here were ancient-feeling with badly stained carpets, trickle of shower water in the morning, bedding that felt creepy-crawly (although no one reported actually seeing bugs). My daughter's room was subjected to loud noise from neighboring misbehaving guests until 3 am. The desk clerk on Saturday morning seemed overwhelmed by guest issues/complaints. For slightly more money, we have stayed in much better budget hotel rooms in this part of Richmond.",Maumee,979

They are slow, falling apart, creaky and honestly a little scary. The hotel staff is nice though and they have free breakfast.

Quality Inn and Suites,John,4.0,"I have stayed at this hotel a number of times, back when it was a Comfort Inn and now as a Quality Inn. It's reliable, affordable and generally I have always been happy when I have stayed here. The free hot breakfast is a nice touch and staff is generally accommodating and helpful. This time however, it seems that the air conditioning was not working in my room, something I wasn't aware of until I finally retired for the evening. Despite setting the thermostat to 60 and the function to cool, it was hot, humid and made it very difficult to sleep comfortably. It was late at night when I turned in, so I bit the bullet because I didn't feel like packing up and moving to another room in the middle of the night. Maybe this was just a malfunction of the A/C in my room and the rest of the rooms are fine, but I would check when you arrive to ensure that you didn't have the same experience that I did.

The gym had no air at all,a broken treadmill weights 20lbs over. Room was TINY. There was also the smell of marijuana on the 5th floor and partying in resulted in someone pulling the fire alarm at midnight and we had to be evacuated.

Quality Inn and Suites,VCU Visiting Parent,1.0,"I am a person that reads reviews but I have never written one before. However, after staying here for two nights i had to give my honest opinion. I was very disappointed with this hotel true it is an older hotel but major repairs are needed starting with the 2 elevators which one has an out of order sign on.. anytime you try to go to the first floor it automatically takes you to the basement then brings you back up. The basement looks scary and filthy if I had the opportunity to see the basement first i know i would never have stayed at this hotel. This is first time I ever felt unsafe at a hotel. The parking deck area needs better lighting to dark. My room was on the 4th floor the hallway smells maybe the carpet needs shampooing or just needs new carpet. The room was clean but bed was very lumpy new mattress needed ...shower pressure was horrible at anytime of the day really horrible ...the free breakfast i woulnt dare eat it do to the lack of upkeep of the facility hotel was...I can't comment on the staff I only saw the front desk person never saw housekeeping crew or maintenance person the hold time.....Otherwise, if the above things dont really bother you then the hotel does offer you a quiet room ....great location (it may not look like it from your hotel window but you're really close to a lot of things) ...good rates...sorry I didn't mean to write a book just wanted to give an honest opinion of my experience. ...",Maumee,979

Best Western of Long Beach,A Traveler,2.0,"When we first looked at our room, it looked as expected. Clean, etc. When we used the bathroom however, I noticed that everything was very very low to the ground: toilet, shower sink counter--So much so that I had to bend my knees and strain my back to reach my hands under the faucet to wash my hands. Kind of annoying since standard counter height for bathrooms now is 36. This counter height was around 26-27 high so I was not happy with that part. Also, water pressure was very low--so that was also annoying. When I woke up---I had bites on my arm that weren't there the night before when I went to sleep. When I went to check out in the morning -- I told the hotel employees about this. The man behind the counter said that since I booked with Hotels.com, they weren't able to do anything compensatory like a discount, etc. First of all---I never asked for a discount or compensation. Besides, it's not a Hotels.com issue---it's a Best Western issue! Later the manager did call me and thanked me for letting them know. He said he would call me back after a thorough room inspection. He never did. Two days later, the bites are still there---but are now healing. I was grossed out and worried about bringing whatever that was back to my house! Also--breakfast was practically inedible. They were out of everything anyway because they were super crowded due to the end-of-breakfast stampede. Suggestion--extend the weekend breakfast hours or start later on the weekends.",Chandler,286

I travel a lot with my job so I may end up stay in a hotel 3 to 8 months.Anyway after the tour I was quoted a rate by the manager D.J. and we agree on it, everything was fine. Well the day before i was to move there. I once again went by there to just confirm my reservation for the next morning. Well D.J.'s wife rudely told me I can't give you that room at the rate her husband quoted me. Then when I asked to speak with him she play evasive games with me saying he wasn't available. So I told her what ever the price is we will work it out in the morning. I want that room. She said OK and I left. Well the next morning I called and just to confirm my reservation and the necessary credit card paper work. Well they charged my company card and when I pulled up, ready to move in D.J.'s wife told me the room was no longer available it was rented out for the week.Since they had my companies money they tried to put me in a room I didn't request. I was furious and walked out. THEY PULLED A CLASSIC BAIT AND SWITCH.. Then had the nerve to call my corporate office and complain. When they were the ones to foul up.

There was mold on the shower curtain on the inside. Water temps and pressure was acceptable. Room - Room lacked storage. No drawers to store belongings. They do have a couple of shelves but are not adequate. Breakfast - Area is very small and does not accomodate normal volumes. Inadequate seating in area. Breakfast items are not replinshed on a regular basis and appeared to be very disorganized. Quality of breakfast items is below average than the Hamptons I have been in in the past.

Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Susan,3.0,"Arrived early evening, last week of August, on Tuesday. We were greeted with a smile and a cookie. When the restaurant we were going to for supper was closed we called the desk and they gave us a restaurant nearby. Excellent suggestion. The room itself was on the 4th floor, very quiet, bed comfortable. Many TV stations available. The air conditioner was efficient and kept us comfortable without a lot of fiddling and adjusting. The one drawback was there was not a micro fridge or microwave in the room. Our fault, we should have read the amenities closer. Breakfast was nice, fruit, make your own waffles, variety of dry cereal, hot eggs and sausage. A little something for everyone. A nice side for me was we arrived just before a storm and the warnings were posted at the desk. Having been in a couple of tornadoes throughout my life, I was relieved to know there is a designated safe room on both ends of the hotel for just that occasion. May not seem important, but if you have been in a tornado you know how comforting it can be to know there is a place to be safe just in case. I would recommend this hotel, just remember to bring a cooler for your leftovers.",Ellensburg,477

At Check-In, I happened to mention conversationally that it was our anniversary. To our surprise, they upgraded our room to a very romantic suite. (It must've been a slow night). The room had everything we could possibly need for our comfort. The view from our window was breathtaking (even saw a hot air balloon). The staff were kind and attentive beyond what we could have hoped for. They treated us like family. Let me add that this is a GREAT place to bring your kids. Instead of a pool, they have an indoor waterpark for all ages. The pictures don't do it justice. They have a hot protein-rich breakfast that is worth paying (over a budget hotel). Play pens and roll-away beds are available when you need them. Great hotel for parents with kids. If I have to be negative, I would say my TV wasn't big enough.

The rooms are HUGE, the bed was very comfortable, the TV has so many channels, it would be impossible not to find something that suited you. The breakfast was very good, although the seating area is pretty cramped. The hotel staff were very friendly and called to make sure we were settled in a half or so after we arrived. We really only have two comments to consider (for both hotel management and those who might want to stay here). First, we were surprised that our room did not have a refrigerator. It's easily one of the largest hotel rooms we have stayed in, so there's plenty of space. Galena is known for its restaurants, and we, like many guests, had leftovers. Thankfully, the temps were low enough that we were able to store it in the car. For such a nicely equipped and modern place, the lack of a refrigerator was surprising. Second, our A/C-heater unit was noisy. I have gotten so used to those things being noisy that I'm considering writing the Amana company and asking them WHY their hotel units are all universally noisy, even when relatively new. It rattled and there was not amount of pushing, shoving, or kicking that would make it stop. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Galena, though we now know to remember we don't have a place to store leftovers. Overall, it's a wonderful hotel.",Sheridan,1546

Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,A Traveler,3.0,"We travel a lot and use Hotels.com ,because it is quick and easy , plus I can see all of the available hotels at once. Usually, we pay cash but, I went ahead and prepaid on my debit card. Once at the hotel. The front desk stated he needed to run it for incidentals. The usual fee for incidentals is 10 to 50 dollars. I was charged the cost of the room again. This is not just this hotel but, becoming an issue with all hotels in Galena. We stayed on Thursday and it took a phone call and eventually by the following Tuesday my money was refunded. Also, our room was against the laundry room. In the middle of the night twice we were awoke by loud machine noises. Was told we would be given extra points on our hotels .com account for the issue. Nothing has showed up there yet.

Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Jonathan,4.0,"My stay was only for one night, but was exactly how I needed it to be: peaceful, clean, cool (it was summer), easy parking, and easy access to surrounding area. There is a very impressive pool area with giant slide, but I did not use it. Several others seemed to enjoy it though. It is marketed as an indoor water park, and it is certainly to the closest thing to a water park in the area. Galena is cute and small, albeit somewhat lacking for a city slicker like me. However, I really love staying in these areas. Service is friendly and basic, and breakfast is a hot buffet with plenty of coffee. Couldn't ask for more at the price.",Madison,937
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,A Traveler,3.0,"I scheduled what I thought would be fun-a suite with a fireplace Steamboat Suite for the evening celebrating my husband's birthday. When we got there I realized I was getting charge again for what was prepaid. When I brought this to the clerk's attention, there was no discretion. Then to make matters worse I got charged AGAIN. That made 3 times! The new clerk couldn't figure out how to reverse it even while being coached on the phone for a LONG time while we were standing there in the small lobby. He still didn't get that he'd charged me twice. He finally called his manager who came back to work. I got called back with no apologies or comps. Then the manager loudly brought it up again as we were having breakfast. I still don't understand what happened, but over 500 was taken out of my checking account and has not found its way back. I understand taking a credit card number in case there are other charges made during the stay, but this was way beyond that. It took about an hour of our time during our stay, not to mention the lack of discretion. It was very disheartening. The room was a disappointment. Yes, there was a fireplace but no way to sit in front of it and maybe have a glass of wine-just the bed. One chair was on the other side of the bed. The steamboat theme came from a print on the wall. It was mostly like another hotel room-not a wow factor, but plenty expensive.",Madison,937

Coffee was great tough. The room was clean but the furniture seems kind of old. Room was quiet although sometimes when other room's door was closing or opening it seemed like it was ours. Pool was not clean, there are several trees around it and a lot of leaves were on it and also there were bees and wasps around the pool, some of them fell on it. Needs more attention.

Many trails to explore in the city. So many great restaurants a short drive away...Anton's is in an historic log cabin. The cheese curds were great at Grizzlie's. I had an excellent eggplant dish at Ciatti's Ristorante, also the mussels were fabulous. This was probably our best meal. These were all a few miles down Division Street.

I called the hotel. they told me the smaller charge was a mistake by the hotel staff. the 150 charge was a fee as they claimed I smoked in the room. I explained that I do not smoke and whoever said that I had smoked in the room was in error and these charges were bogus and fraudulent. The hotel promised they would get back to me the same day.

The AC/Heater was so loud when running it was difficult to hear the old fashioned tv. No mini fridge, microwave or coffee maker. Cheap toiletries, we got two shampoos instead of a shampoo and conditioner. The towels were small and rough, some had stains on them. Breakfast was cheap, no fruit or yogurt. I have celiac disease and there was absolutely nothing I could eat. Juice was containers in a small fridge you had to pour yourself. The sound system playing throughout the hotel was playing hip hop music. The young man at the front desk had a hoodie on and kept his hood up while he talked on the phone the whole time.

We looked around, didn't see anything else out of order and went to get the same night guy. He came up, moved the chair and thought that was that. He said there were no more clean rooms, then went to double check that. He went into a room just down from ours and came out 10 mins later w trash and dirty towels. He tried to give us that room. He could not verify that the sheets had been changed and said he didn't blame us for not wanting to stay in the room! LOL Then he offered us another room and we went to check it out.

I heard every faucet being turned on, every thing the neighbors said and every door close and open. I think the walls between the rooms were an illusion because they certainly didn't block anything except who was in the room next door. It was of course the last room and we were so incredibly road weary. We to stuck with it. And the room smelled like someone had just gone in there and let one rip.

The on duty manager claimed she would keep us on a list even if no room became available, there was never an attempt to reach out and apologize or try to accommodate us in anyway. Her response was we can move you to a ground room at a higher rate... Really We didn't screw up you did. Our room was always cleaned after 3pm accept for one day where the house cleaner was amazing!

The parents didn't really watch, and no staff were supervising the area to give reminders about horseplay, diving, etc, so adults were splashed and crowded at times. Everything! Breakfast was great, the beds were comfortable, and our room overlooked the beach (literally steps away). The staff were amazingly attentive (my aunt slid in the bar area and was immediately surrounded by 3-5 staff including the manager, all assisting and asking her if she was ok or needed anything). During breakfast, there was a sweet woman making multiple rounds, checking in on everyone and everything. The food at the bar was great. Our rooms were large and very clean. Despite being on the beach, there was no musty smell or sand in the rooms. Our balconies were great and gave us a free first class seat to the fireworks show just a few hundred yards from the hotel.

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,A Traveler,4.0,It was overall ok. The pros: The location was perfect right on the beach next to all the entertainment and restaurants. Free breakfast with a descent selection. . The cons: The only pool this hotel had was indoor! It did have a hot tub both pool and hot tub below average. The pool area only had 5 lounge chairs. Very small. We were torn between this and the Hilton next door which is a notch up due to the Hampton inn having free breakfast and the Hilton having a nicer pool area. We figured that we would save more with the free breakfast and went with the Hampton in. But after being there I would do the Hilton because of pool. It gives you more of a vacation feel. We figured we had the beach so the pool was not a factor. But we went with kids and the beach can be exhausting! Also the elevator and hallways were so hot no AC in those areas.,Waldorf,1780

When I see this type of sloppiness, I see an absent or uncaring manager.",Evansville,503

The neighborhood is very beautiful, especially in fall. We had a king size room - it was clean and spacious. We appreciated the nice sitting area, in-room fridge and other amenities that made it comfortable. The bathroom was well maintained. We frequented at the first floor restaurant/bar area both nights. Yes it is a bit pricey for drinks, but what can you expect. It was decent quality and good for meeting up with friends for drinks and conversation. I would stay here again if we were in the area.",Evansville,503

Courtyard By Marriott Rockaway Mount Arlington,A Traveler,3.0,"Unimpressed. We booked three identical rooms. When we checked in, we found that one room came with a medium sized fridge and microwave, one came with a small fridge that looked like it took a tumble down a flight of stairs and no microwave, and the last room came with nothing. Breakfast offered seemed a little expensive for microwaved sandwiches and there wasn't even free coffee in the lobby. There was, however, room temperature cucumber infused water. The alarm clocks in more than one surrounding room went off early in the morning and kept going, indicating the rooms were empty. A call to the front desk got it resolved, but then it happened again the next morning. Really The hotel was clean and in a nice area. It snowed one night and the parking lot and walkways were promptly cleared. Front desk staff was pleasant but not terribly helpful. I guess I expected more for a Courtyard by Marriott.",Evansville,503

Courtyard By Marriott Rockaway Mount Arlington,A Traveler,3.0,"I stayed here along with several others in a group. I discovered at breakfast that they had reserved their stay directly with the hotel and received benefits I did not, and in fact paid a significant amount less than I did by claiming government rates though none were government employees: they received normal rooms while I was given a handicap-accessible bathroom. The mirror was angled down so I could not see myself in it while doing hair and makeup the shower head was so low that I hit my eye on it while rinsing. Of course I would have requested to change rooms had I been prescient enough to know the trouble I would have in the morning. I complained about my room to the front desk in the morning and was offered an apology. The rest of my team received hotel breakfast vouchers while I had to pay for breakfast and coffee at the bar, which does not offer competitive rates or quality. This hotel does not have the option of a continental breakfast nor does it offer its patrons free self-serve coffee like most others. Its coffee is Starbucks brand and was not Starbucks quality. Also: there was no refrigerator in my room and I do not know if any rooms do have one.",Evansville,503
Courtyard By Marriott Rockaway Mount Arlington,Paul,3.0,"Overall it has the appearance of a nice place, however it is clear that they don't have money to fix or clean. Mildew in the shower is not excusable, refrigerator cabinets devoid of a fridge. The pool was freezing because some customer 'turned off the heat' so they could swim laps, that really isn't excusable as the hotel pool should be for the majority of guests. Please someone clean the pool area and the 'skylight' area which appeared cobweb-spider infested and hasn't been cleaned ... ever. The exercise room was actually nice as was the bar area/restaurant. Hotelscom lists the place as having a breakfast buffet and included it in price, however the 'hotel wouldn't honor it' and the manager said they NEVER do buffets on the weekend (but on Sunday it was there at 11.95 adults and 6.95 children) - scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and hash browns (which were actually home fries, cubes potatoes with onions) and a few muffins. What other places would give you for free. That was disappointing. However I give hotelscom credit for contacting the hotel and setting the record and price straight. Just messed the morning plans as I wasn't going to shell out 40 for a awful breakfast that they were supposed to include (it's the premise of it). Would I stay again Hmm... given there are other options in the area, the pool and room wasn't good I'd go to a Hilton Garden Inn (free cookies.. nice rooms), and though this place said they had cookies I never saw them.",Evansville,503

Baymont Inn and Suites Boone,A Traveler,1.0,"HORRIBLE! Our room smelled like urine the second we walked in. My daughter later noticed 2 men's razors in the shower along with hair and a chunk of soap bar in the drain. Obviously, the bathroom (and the rest of the room) was never cleaned from the previous visitors, which in a small town, could have been the previous weekend ( They started putting all the breakfast items away 15 min before closing. Which was probably a blessing bc the jelly we got was so old, it was hardened in the little containers. The computer in the business center was so old, it actually had a floppy drive. The front desk girl was nice, that was the only part of the stay that was not physically nauseating. Upon checkout, we mentioned the in- clean bathroom and the rotten jelly packets, to which we received an apology but no refund (even partial), an offer for a discounted stay, etc. I will never stay here again.

Handed us rooms keys for rooms that had yet to be cleaned. 4. Breakfast area had not been cleaned and at 7:30pm, had to ask for a rag and cleaner to clean ourselves. Floor was disgustingly dirty. 5. No washcloths or linens for pull out bed. 6. Coffee maker broken, pieces left sitting on the tray. This has to be the worst hotel experience I've ever had.",Hastings,681

The fresh fruit was little to be desired. No spray for the waffle maker so my attempt to have a waffle was poor, although the way it came out I didn't have to cut it as it was already in pieces.

The room was clean and well-appointed and all rooms have balconies overlooking the ocean with the hallway providing panoramic windows to look out to the west. The only real distraction was that the construction type of the building and the heaviness of the doors and spring action needed to shut the doors meant that you heard every door on the floor close very clearly and you could hear noises from the room next door. It doesn't seem like much except that everything else is quite silent. It is why I only give the comfort level a 3 out of 5 as it is hard to get comfortable when you hear doors slamming shut all of the time.",Martinsburg,966

When we first walked into our room there was a weird mildew type smell in the room and the towels in the bathroom smelled the same way. We had to open the sliding door to let some fresh air into the room. The pictures for this hotel look much nicer than the actual rooms, our bathroom had very little space and the countertop near the sink had a large crack. We had to kill a couple of bugs during our two night stay and the overpriced Coke machine outside of the room had expired drinks. The last morning of our trip the toilet stopped flushing and that was kind of the last straw with this hotel, we were glad to be checking out and we would not recommend staying here. We did make management at the front desk aware of our experience and they gave us a free Coke and a membership to their rewards program with around 10,000 points to make up for the issues... the points do not even come close to giving us any rewards through their program.

Had to keep running the exhaust fan 24hrs to get rid of smell, good thing was, atleast it worked. For the mattresses, one queen mattress was good enough to hold 2 adults without sagging. Other mattress was terrible seems like the coil was damaged. As soon as I sat on the mattress it depressed 3-4 inches. We avoided to use that mattress to avert back pain.

The lady I talked with at the front desk had no personality at all. I told her I had reservations with a early check in time and when she first open her mouth I knew this was not going to go well. She told me it would be around 2PM before I could get a room so I ask her would she put me on the top of the list for the first room because i had been traveling all day. the no personality come out again in her and I know we would not get a room early. when I stepped out to the car I told my wife we could forget a early check in and I was right. We set in the lobby in plain view of the front desk watching guest being checked in. Finally after sitting there from 11AM to 1:45PM I stepped back up to the desk and ask why I'm sitting here for about three hours watching people being checked in. she told me it was the type room i was getting. There was another lady there this time listening to what i was saying that i had been sitting here for about three hours. I left and went set back down at 1:55PM. 1:58PM they called me back up there and gave me the keys. She was making me wait to show me she was in control and she cared less about the guest. I have stayed at about 95 of the motels up and down Virginia Beach through out the last ten years this includes the other Holiday Inn with no problems but the check in at the Holiday Inn Express ruin my whole trip.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,Jennifer,7.5,"The price in comparison to some of the more upscale hotels a couple blocks up the boardwalk is a little high. We'd never been to VA Beach and realized the location of this hotel, while very close walking distance to a lot of stores, was not exactly where we had wanted to be. There seemed to be much nicer hotels and stores about 4-5 blocks up in the 30th Street area but that area is still easy to walk to. The rooms could definitely use an upgrade to decor - they're a bit tacky and older looking however, still clean and the bed was pretty comfortable. Now if you ask my husband, his only concern of the trip would be Nowhere here sells funnel cake! which we thought was very strange, but of course has nothing to do with the hotel itself. Every staff member we encountered was very friendly. The proximity and access to the beach area was great and loved the complimentary breakfast (although I would recommend checking milk labels, I accidentally drank one that was no longer good and spent that day feeling terrible).

Despite my complaining, it went on till well after 11 p.m. I was not able to sleep, read or think due to the sound.

The female manager (Australian, I believe) was quick to offer to comp us a night which I thought was odd. Fast forward to our last night: the comp was only a credit for a partial night but in turn she drastically increased the rate of our last night making the room 3 times what we booked for. She locked us out of our room and refused to give us access to our belongings until we paid the inflated amount. We were left on a Friday night with the option to pay or leave.

The parking garage is dark and not easily seen if there's a problem, and the door into hotel says to use room key - but not only do you not need a key, the door doesn't even latch, and it appears a new handle was put in place to override the latch/lock handle. Interior is accessable to anyone and there did appear to be someone in the garage area who didn't seem to have any business there.

They said that was the only alternative unless I wanted to park in the street - across from the hotel - NOT on the same side of the street where they would have been able to keep an eye on my equipment.

Empty water bottle found in room under a chair while just placing my bag down. I found the same kinda water in the fridge. It was an 8 pack with only one full one left in it. I have no idea if it was supplied by the hotel or not. We threw it out. The toilet made a high pitched noise that would only stop it after you flushed it again. The Kleenex tissue had only 1 tissue and was never replaced at all. The morning we left when we stopped by the continental breakfast the same employee that checked me in was there. She acknowledged 1/10 people in the room. I even said good morning to no reply. It was a convenient location for our trip to Becker College for our son. We had a 2 day orientation and would have had a more pleasant stay here if things like this were actually addressed. I know it's hard work and not appreciated by many. But as for someone that works in customer service every day myself I was amazed by the lack of interaction between hotel staff and guests. These things reflect upon upper management. Maybe some team building exercises to make their job not just a job but a fun and good safe place to work as well. If I was to stay here again it would be simply because of location...:),Warsaw,1789

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,C,4.0,"The La Quinta, Auburn,MA is a great place to stay in the area: it is conveniently located, the rooms are very nice, clean, the complimentary breakfast is great,and the staff is pleasant, friendly, helpful. My only negative things I would say are that there was only one chair in our double bed room, but I'm sure if we had asked. the staff would've gotten us another chair! The biggest issue is the layout of the bathroom. I only saw 2 rooms, so I don't know if they are all like this, but the shower/tub is in a narrow little closet-like room with a toilet. The sink and counter is outside that space in an area next to the door of the room is not screened off in any way from the bedroom section. As a disabled person, I frequently take sponge baths at the bathroom sink. In this situation there was absolutely no privacy to do so, which was inconvenient for me. If all you do at the sink is brush your teeth comb your hair, this won't be an issue for you. But I didn't like the thought of people using the toilet, then using the doorknob with unwashed hands to get out to the area to wash their hands. Besides inconvenient, it seemed unhygienic to me.

There are no microwaves or refrigerators in the standard rooms and you won't get one even if you request it. So we ate our own food in the kitchen room( to microwave the food) that night. This lady seemed to be VERY UPSET because she had to clean the trash can once again(as we threw our left overs there). She showed her frustration to us. we felt this very disrespectful as she was frustrated JUST because she has to clean that trash can once again!

I was in a pet friendly room, however I expected it to be clean. Otherwise, the room was ok, could have been cleaner, floor in the tub felt unsteady and ceiling had questionable spots. Also the tv reception faded in and out and on my second night completely cut out and never returned. Breakfast was free but not worth the time it took to get downstairs. The first morning was ok, as they offered hard boiled eggs and fresh fruit. Morning 2 was only waffles, cold cereal and toast. No healthy options for those of us uninterested in a processed breakfast. The staff was friendly, location and parking was good, and I liked the fact that they don't charge additional fees for pets.

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,Lisa,3.0,"The hotel was full the night we stayed - on a Saturday. Stayed on the first floor and heard some little child running back and forth for about an hour as we were unwinding and trying to go to sleep. Fortunately we discovered the television has a few themed screens which play environmental sounds. We chose the full moon over the ocean and finally let the ocean waves lull us to sleep. The hallway definitely smelled of cigarette smoke, but fortunately the room did not. However, they sprayed with scented spray, despite my request otherwise. The breakfast was not anything we wanted - all breads, cereals, waffles. I have a gluten intolerance. So I grabbed an apple and went elsewhere. The coffee ran out early and wasn't that good - bitter. The hot water for tea wasn't quite hot enough to make true tea. The bed was fairly comfortable - very firm and the pillows were a bit too chunky for my preference. The fan in the bathroom was quite loud. No night lights, but the full moon theme on the television sufficed as a night light.",Ottawa,1233

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,David,2.0,"The hotel was good for commuting near the highway, but this Clarion was dirty. It would be such a great spot anytime when going to CT, but they just need to clean. The room wasn't bad inside. The flooring throughout all common areas: stairs,dining room rugs, tile floors, and hallways haven't been kept up. I would estimate at least 2-3 weeks without sweeping. The worst was the pool area. Crazy amounts of hair all over the floors. Not just from one day, but at least 2 months worth. It was so gross. Not sure if an entire family manscaped or what. It would be a really great place, if they cleaned and washed Windows. As soon as we pulled in , I told my wife if the landscaping looks like this, we should go somewhere else. I can't under stand how the grass and neglect of landscaping can't be taken care of. It would take a maintenance person 2 hours a week, but I guess the ownership doesn't care.

As far as the hotel it has had a few updates as far as the hallways with new carpet. But the rooms themselves are getting a little outdated, but still comfortable and clean. We've only been in the pool a few times, it seems no matter what time of year we go it's always cold and the pool area and hot tub is outdated. The Starbucks on location is a nice added touch, a little more pricey and they stopped giving free water like all other Starbucks locations- the Disneyland Starbucks with your annual pass discount is cheaper and they give you free water in their cups if you ask.

Anaheim Marriott Suites,J,3.0,"I booked this room thru Expedia. As Marriott normally does for such reservations, they provide you with a room at the stated rate but that room is, IMHO, the worst of the lot. In my case, I was assigned a wheelchair accessible room which meant that shelves and counterspace were slightly lower than normal. This made things more difficult for me since I stand nearly two meters in height and have a bad back. However, I decided I could tough it out given my late arrival and lack of desire to wander back to the front desk and request a change - which I would probably not be provided. Rather interestingly, I have booked rooms at five hotels in the past two weeks. Marriott was the only chain which provided a room of this sort. As for the hotel, it is quite large and the lobby is well lit. I was not aware of the Marriott Suites concept and was pleased with the size and comfort of the room. However, in the process of checking in and checking out, I found the staff to be both efficient but not that friendly. I also did not appreciate the housekeeping staff banging on my room door at 8:00 in the morning. When I did not answer, the staff proceeded to force her way into the room despite the fact the door was deadbolted and the swinglock engaged. Shame on me for not placing the do not disturb sign out prior to my shower. Thankfully, parking was free but internet was not. Another disappointment. There are lots of hotels in the vicinity. I'll try another on my next trip",Greenville,650

Pillows were insanely tiny and flat. Broken clock. Drunk people all over the balcony and below us. Someone banged on our door at 5am and ran away. The ironing board, with no cover, didn't stand.

They are adding lanes to I-5 and building a new onramp on the gigantic slope which faces the hotel. You can hear the beeping of the machines all day but somewhat muffled if you have the fan ON (not auto). So I guess I can't complain although it is such a horrible noise and you don't want to open the door to the tiny balcony.

Upon check-in, the front desk had already confused our reservation with someone else's. They blamed it on hotels.com. Then they sent us up to a room with someone already in it- we could hear the tv from the hallway. Went back to the front desk, again blaming it on the hotels.com reservation. They said the reservation number had affected the room number, which is just dumb. Sent down to another room, with 2 queens when the room was booked for a king. Called up to the front desk, they made us come up to get service for yet another room and finally sent us to a king room. Not much to get excited about. The walls were thin and you could hear people through out the night. Breakfast had a wide variety of food, but it was all heat and serve, nothing was cooked fresh.

Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Sharon,3.0,"Very small bathrooms...might be a problem for larger or older people. Also room we were given had an air conditioning unit that was very loud. When we asked the staff if this was normal we were told yes they all pretty much were loud. First night staying there the unit was so loud when it came on that we were woken up multiple times during the wee hours. Asked staff to change rooms next morning and they did switch our room without a problem. The staff was great and there was free breakfast included in the stay, but the breakfast area was crowded with lots of people...So if that bothers you you may want to pass on free breakfast. Also the second room we were given also had problems, still noisy ac unit and also a very noisy bathroom fan. It too was very loud and no I'm not being fussy, it was on its last leg...I think the hotel has some maintenance issues and taking that into consideration it may be a bit too expensive considering.. Also pool was in the worst spot they could have put it...it was right off the lobby making access uncomfortable and not private or a relaxing area at all.

Complimentary breakfast was great and so convenient for my family of 4 and saved us some money eating at the hotel. Hotel property was clean and pretty.

This was our choice as the hot tub was out of order in the first hotel and we really wanted to spend the evening in a hot tub. The first night we stayed at the Drury Inn in Grove City which was a 10-15 minute drive. That hotel was recently remodeled, so the rooms there were fresh looking and had a new feel to them. The Drury Inn downtown had the same great layout, but was just older. Both places had free popcorn and soda, a free happy hour (get the wine), and served free food throughout the day, which helps you save a little on food during your stay.",Grafton,621

Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,A Traveler,5.0,"The Drury was great, as usual. The only complaint I have is that the room smelled of smoke. Since neither of us smoke AND the hotel is supposed to be completely smoke-free, that wasn't pleasant (thank goodness, we always bring a can of febreeze). Thankfully, it wasn't over-powering. They did offer to come check it out, but I was more concerned with not getting charged for smoking in the room, which is why I brought it up to the front desk staff. The breakfast is nice and the evening kickback (baked potatoes, nachos, hot dogs, soups, salad, etc.) is nice, too. It's all free and it's good. The room was comfortable and it was quite large. We had a coupon for a free upgrade, otherwise, I'm sure the room wouldn't have been nearly so large. The view of downtown Columbus was great!

Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,A Traveler,3.0,"We stayed for 6 nights. Mostly because of the price and location. We visited Sonoma and Napa primarily and had about a 30-40 minute drive to each. There are also some good breweries within 10 miles. Our favorite was the Cooperage Brewery. PROS Good Location. I got a courtyard room and it was quiet. The bathroom was also clean. Make sure you get a Courtyard Room if you don't want to hear traffic noise all night like I read in other reviews. CONS The carpets needs to be cleaned! After taking my shoes and walking around in the room, I stepped on the towel in the bathroom and my foot left black marks on the towel. Even after showering and washing my feet I would walk barefoot on the carpeted floor and then step on the towel again and black marks again. The bed was a bit hard and small. We reserved a queen but I think they put us in a double. Or somehow my queen bed at home is bigger. The shower head limited the water pressure which made it difficult to rinse all the soap off and it made my Wife's showers take forever to get her hair washed. I think I'm going to start bringing a shower head and a wrench when I travel. I live in California so our shower heads are already limited. But the hotels go too far. The bathroom towels felt like sand paper, where VERY scratchy, and very small. We ended up just using our beach towels that we had brought.",Mandurah,945

I went with my husband to participate in a race the next day, and I didn't get any sleep. The bed was more of a full than a queen and I kept getting woken up every time my husband moved. The room guests next door entered their room so late, and they were slamming doors and talking very loud and one could hear everything. In the early morning, I was trying to take a shower and the shower head was all messed up, so the water accumulated into a puddle outside of the tub and I had to use my towel to soak it up. We had to share a hand towel, also.",Mandurah,945

The air conditioner had an intense musty smell and was probably the original A/C from when the hotel was built. The bathroom had quite a bit of hair on the floor and the grout was dirty everywhere. On the plus side, the sheets were comfortable, good pillows and the A/C cooled the room real well.

Red Roof Inn Cedar Rapids,Kristin,2.0,"I would not recommend anyone to stay at the Red Roof Inn in Cedar Rapids. I would say most of the rooms were taken by people who live at the hotel and not just guests. Several people just hanging around outside sitting in lawn chairs by their room doors, other people walking around barefoot all over the hotel. The women at the counter were both very nice and helpful. Some of the building areas were falling apart. The carpeting was filthy and we were given rooms clear in the back maze of the motel because it appeared the residents were occupying any rooms that had direct outside access or balconies. People were literally moving in on the day we arrived. Unless you are desperate for a room avoid this place.",Durango,443

Even though the room was prepaid, this time they insisted on taking a credit card for any damage I may cause. They did not do this last week. I checked the room closely for fear that I may get charged. The door would not close unless I pushed it shut (140). The remote control for the TV was broken. On the 3rd try we found a remote that sort of worked. It skipped 2 channels at a time but at least worked. The sink had a long crack and the tub had a hole. There was an old wash cloth left on the shower rod. The bed was comfortable. I like that they give you 4 pillows of different levels of softness. Overall, just an OK stay this time.",Durango,443

So as the line formed one person doing the check in had to count out her till, so she could not check anyone in at 3 which was poor timing. Then they both had attitudes about how busy it was, when they could have been checking people in at least as early as 2:30. So on top of it the cleaning guy has to vacuum the lobby and waiting area right at this time when the lobby is packed waiting to check in. The room was dirty. My bed look like it had been slept in.

The security was exceptional. Having to use the room key to access the elevator is a big plus. However, once the elevator doors opened up on the third floor, I was very disappointed. The carpets were old and tattered, especially where the carpet was pieced together. I took a picture of the carpet but am unable to take it off my phone. Once we entered our room, it was very small for two adults, a twelve year old boy, and his cousin who was a seven year old girl. We had brought an inflatable mattress for the seven year old girl to sleep on and we were unable to set it up. So, we had to make different sleeping arrangements because I was uncomfortable with the cousins sleeping together. The bed that I slept in was very uncomfortable.

They also checked the AC unit and pulled the filter while they were in the room. Wi-Fi was decent although sitting by the window you'd loose it. The bed was comfortable and I got a decent night's sleep on it. Room had no fridge, microwave or coffee pot. There was a multi outlet by the bed with USB ports built in.

The light bulbs on the lamps that did work were covered with dust, giving off kind of a burning smell. The conditions outside the room were deplorable. The concrete walkways were crumbling. There were rubber rugs laid down that were uneven. A paint job is long overdue. Within minutes we were approached by someone asking for money so they could get a room. (speaks to location, not the fault of the hotel.) The lobby area was nice. The breakfast was non-remarkable--not much to it. Probably won't stay there again.

Fiancee did not like that the room door was so close to the parking lot. I didn't mind, personally. Lots of hotels are like this. Stuff was a little dated, and the room was a bit like a cave with windows only in front. I didn't mind this either. :) I really enjoyed the whole experience. The free breakfast was pretty good with a lot of choice. Paid about 100 which I still think is way too much, but maybe I'm just old and cranky.",Pilot Butte,1288

There was a lot of noise from the parking lot (doors opening/closing all night, people talking, etc.). Quite frankly, I expected more for a room that cost nearly 100. This was the most expensive room on our trip and it was by far the one that needed updating the most. The beds were old, the water pressure in the shower was a joke, just overall worn and dated.

Hotel is older, what was a resort, converted and remodeled. While it has a 2.5 star rating I don't know why. Restaurant, lounge and pool on-site should make it a 3 star. Good business hotel, although that is not what we were there for.",Dayton,407

The hotel is beautiful inside as well.",Dayton,407
Holiday Inn Victorville,d,3.0,We stayed here twice the room was spacious and clean the problems with the hotel are not the rooms. Both stays key cards didnt work when going to the room the first time had to go back down very inconvenient when your tired from traveling. And during our stay they got demagnetized again. Room service got our breakfast order wrong. We left the room in the morning and came back in the evening and the room service breakfast tray we had from the morning was still outside in the hallway it was 9:30 at night! The next night I hung the breakfast order from the door on the little slip provided. In the morning when it was close to 8:30 I checked outside and the slip was still there no one had picked it up. It should be noted it was placed on the door during the allotted hours. Staff when notified were nice and quick to fix the problem. Both stays at this hotel we stayed Friday and sat checked out on Sunday. Our first visit the room didn't get cleaned on Saturday and we left around ten and came back in the evening. Breakfast was ok not really worth the steep delivery fee. The food wasn't the best quality.,Dayton,407

Holiday Inn Victorville,A Traveler,4.0,"We live an hour away and staying here one night allowed us to shop, eat and relax without having to rush home. Our room was large, clean and quite. The hotel seems brand new. The staff was nice. I just hate when there is no fan in the bathroom. I can't imagine the constant steam is a good thing. I read some reviews about the food so we decided to pay a little extra for the breakfast deal. It was not worth it in my opinion. Kids eat free which was nice but we still paid extra for what we needed and the taste was not great. The juices even had a bad plastic after taste. I would stay here again, I just wouldn't bother eating there.",Dayton,407
Holiday Inn Victorville,Les,2.0,"Basically a party hotel. Booked a room for king size bed but was given a room with two double beds.

Americas Best Value Inn,A Traveler,1.0,"Having stayed at other locations operated by this chain, I knew not to expect 4 or 5 star lodging, but I did expect more than what we experienced. The hotel ( more like a motor inn), for its part, seems to be trying to improve, but, it still needs a lot of work. The easiest way for me to do this is to list all of the issues we had, so, here goes: 1. Non-smoking room next to a smoking room a room that still reeks of stale cigarette smoke. 2. There was daylight coming through gaps at the top and bottom of the door frame, thus allowing the cool air to escape and the heat and humidity in. 3. Climate control! The ac was set at 76 degrees and we couldn't override the temp to try to make the room more comfortable. 4. Loud and unruly guests and there children hanging in the parking lot very late making tons of noise. 5. Being awakened at 5:30 am on a Saturday to the screams of a woman fighting with her boyfriend right outside our door! 6. After finally getting back to sleep after the incident mentioned in 5, being re-awakened at 9 am on the same Saturday by the sounds of the building being power washed.

One of the guest went to the front counter and spoke to the clerk there and the clerk gave him a fan for me to use. It was only suppose to be for 1 night so the next morning we checked out and went to complete our business in Florence. We ended up not being able to conclude our business so we came back and got another room for that night and used the fan again.

The staff, however, was really understanding and literally walked me all over the hotel to find a room I was comfortable with. Apparently, they have just renovated and the bug spray smell is very strong in some rooms. We found a room that smelled fine and enjoyed our stay.

The first time they took my food and put me through a hard time getting it back. The manager Anil P. Motwani was hard to find, I didn't get in contact with him once. When I finally got my food back they kept my chicken. The second time I got screwed over, I check into the hotel around 2 a.m. Saturday morning, the lady at the front desk was not there I had to stand there and wait by that time I got tired and went to see if she was in the bar (The Edge) and there she was. She checked me in and I ask her what time did I have to check out she said Sunday Morning at 11 a.m. so Saturday around 2 p.m. they came and told me I had to check out the room and the manager also stated then We never let people stay over 24 hours.

The temperature was perfect. The room had a microwave and refrigerator. There were a couple cons about the experience. The exhaust fan in the bathroom was hanging off the ceiling when we arrived.
