# TASK 1

Develop and evaluate a linear regression model to predict **house prices** in Nigeria using the scikit-learn library in Python.

Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Ensure to use *mean_squared_error* and *variance score* as the error metrics.

```Tips:  Use well-documented Python script (e.g., Jupyter Notebook) and descriptive variable names for better code readability. Include comments to explain your code and thought process.```

This assignment equips you with hands-on experience in building and evaluating linear regression models for real estate price prediction in Nigeria. Following these steps and exploring further will enhance your understanding of machine learning concepts.
