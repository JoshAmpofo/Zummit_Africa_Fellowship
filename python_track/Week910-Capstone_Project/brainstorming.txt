Define the Functionalities:
List down the sequence analysis tasks you want the application to perform. This could include tasks such as counting nucleotide bases, calculating GC content, identifying motifs, or any other sequence-related analysis.

Design the User Interface:
Decide on the layout and features of your GUI. Consider using libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy for building the GUI. Plan out how users will input sequences (typing or file upload), view results, and interact with the application.

Set Up the Project Structure:
Create a directory structure for your project. This might include separate folders for scripts, GUI files, test cases, and documentation.

Implement the Sequence Analysis Algorithms:
Write Python functions or classes to perform the sequence analysis tasks defined earlier. These functions/classes should take sequence data as input and return the analysis results.

Integrate GUI with Backend Logic:
Link the user interface components (buttons, text fields, etc.) with the backend logic (sequence analysis algorithms). Implement event handlers to trigger sequence analysis when users interact with the GUI.

Handle Input Validation:
Implement validation mechanisms to ensure that users provide valid sequence data. This may include checking for the correct format, length, and content of the input sequences.

Display Analysis Results:
Design a way to present the results of sequence analysis to the user within the GUI. This could involve displaying the results in text fields, tables, graphs, or any other suitable format.

Test the Application:
Write test cases to verify the correctness of the sequence analysis algorithms and GUI functionality. Test various input scenarios to ensure that the application behaves as expected.

Optimize and Refactor Code:
Review your code for readability, efficiency, and maintainability. Refactor any sections of code that could be improved and optimize performance where necessary.

Document the Application:
Write documentation for your application, including a user guide explaining how to use the GUI and an API reference for developers who may want to extend or modify the functionality.

Deploy and Distribute:
Package your application for distribution. Depending on your target audience, you might distribute it as a standalone executable, a Python package, or through a platform like PyPI.

Gather Feedback and Iterate:
Release your application to users and gather feedback. Use this feedback to identify areas for improvement and iterate on your application to make it better.
