Personal Statement
Several experiences have shaped my interest in pursuing a career as a leading researcher in Plant Sciences. One of such experiences was a documentary I happened to watch as a child on famine in Africa. As little as I was, I came to understand the devastating effect of lack of food on the overall health of humans. I began asking myself how this problem can be abated. Countless hours of watching documentaries on how scientific discoveries were driving technologies that could be used to improve various aspects of human existence led me to develop an interest in the sciences especially plant biology and genetics. As such I went ahead to read Molecular Biology and Biotechnology during my undergraduate studies. This program exposed me to numerous areas in the field of biology that further deepened my interest in plant biology. As a student, my dedication to my academics as well as determination and hard work led me to succeed in notable modules in the program such as plant physiology, phylogeny and morphology of higher plants, biotechnology, microbiology and tissue culture techniques among many others. The desire for excellence led to me being adjudged the best graduating student in recombinant DNA and GM technology in the Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology as well as becoming the Vice President of the studentsâ€™ association of the department. The office of Vice President helped me develop my communication, teamwork and leadership skills. I together with my team organized seminars on biotechnology as well as educational trips to local research institutions. I together with the President of the association collaborated with three other local universities to establish a national association of molecular biology and biotechnology students. I believe these experiences have prepared me adequately to pursue postgraduate studies.
The second experience that shaped my interest in plant sciences was when I served as an intern in the department. As an intern I worked with Professor Aaron Asare on his project to investigate the effects of the growth regulator 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) on in vitro cultures of a local variety of sugarcane. This project caused me to develop a deep interest in plant tissue culture and how it can be applied to crop improvement. 
This led me to carry out my final year project in plant tissue culture where I investigated the effects of different concentrations of BAP and varying light intensities on shoot cultures of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) variety B41-227. I also assisted Professor Asare with his cowpea project leading to the successful release of seven varieties locally. All these experiences have helped me realized that I want to be involved in developing solutions that would contribute to realizing one of the sustainable development goals of zero hunger by the United Nations Development Program in Africa and the global community.
Earning an MSc. in Plant Sciences would be the ideal vehicle to fulfill my goal of studying molecular breeding and plant improvement. I feel that the training experiences offered by Wageningen University and Research are a perfect match for my career goals. I am interested in how molecular breeding techniques can be used to produce crops that are resistant to drought and insects as well as suited to growing in different soil and environmental conditions. My postgraduate studies in Plant Sciences with specialization in plant breeding and genetic resources would enable me to contribute to current research work being conducted by Wageningen in plant breeding to help end world hunger in 2050.
The rich student diversity, convenient and friendly environment for studying, excellent teacher-student ratio as well as top-rated research programs would contribute to my overall development as a well-rounded researcher and innovator in plant improvement and agricultural technologies. I believe that your close collaboration with real world businesses and industry-oriented study will give me a competitive advantage for my future professional experience.
